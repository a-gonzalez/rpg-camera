Thanks to Frank's Laboratory (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5PkdYFbS4K4) for another great lesson.

Do you want to build pixel art games that extend beyond a single screen for your players to discover and explore? Then you need to understand how to implement 2D camera into your projects. It might be easier than you think. This class is for beginners, basic understanding of programming principles is recommended to get the maximum value.

In this lesson we will learn:

    How to implement 2D camera
    How to create game world using 2 layers of tiles (ground layer + vegetation layer)
